# **San's SkinCare - E-commerce Web**

**San's SkinCare** is a responsive e-commerce website created as my first school project.
The project features a fictional skincare brand where users can browse products, add items to their shopping cart, and mark favorites.
It showcases essential web development skills using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## **Technologies Used**

- **HTML**: Structuring the layout of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling the web pages, with responsiveness in mind.
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity for features like shopping cart, favorites, and navigation.
